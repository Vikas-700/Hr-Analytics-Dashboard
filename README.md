# Hr-Analytics-Dashboard

I recently completed a project focusing on HR analytics using Power BI. This dashboard provides deep insights into various aspects of employee data, including:

Attrition Rate: 16.1% of employees have left the company, with the highest attrition in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%).
Average Employee Stats: Average age is 36.92 years, average salary is $6.50K, and average years of service is 7.01 years.
Attrition by Age & Gender: Most attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group, with male employees having a higher attrition rate.
Attrition by Salary & Job Role: Majority of employees with salaries up to $5K have left the company, with Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives being the most affected roles.
ðŸ’¼ Key Visuals:

Attrition by Education
Attrition by Age Group
Job Role-specific Attrition
Gender-wise Attrition Distribution
This project was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques and gain insights that can help improve HR strategies.
